1. PYTORCH BASICS 
   EVA5B2S3X.ipynb
   
2.TRAIN AN MNIST DATA SET AND STORE LOG
   MNIST_BASIC.ipynb

3.TRAIN AN EMNIST DATA AND STORE LOGS 
  COSTRAINTS :
  Make a network that has:
  
	1.6 Convolution layers with these kernels (10, 10, 20, 20, 30)
	2.no fully connected layer (you probably may have to use the Global Average Pooling layer)
	3.uses EMNIST as the dataset
	4.uses a maximum of 2 max-pooling layers
	
	5.Your code MUST be:
		a.well documented
	    b.must mention the receptive field calculations (as we discussed in the class)
	    c.must mention the input and output size for each layer
	    d.must be trained for minimum of 20 epochs
	    e.training MUST happen on the GPU
	
	6.Once done, upload the code with training logs from colab to GitHub, and share the GitHub link
