**Target**

Train CIFAR 10 with below constraints

**CONSTRAINT**

1.change the code such that it uses GPU

2.change the architecture to C1C2C3C40 (basically 3 MPs)

3.total RF must be more than 44

4.one of the layers must use Depthwise Separable Convolution

5.one of the layers must use Dilated Convolution

6.use GAP (compulsory):- add FC after GAP to target #of classes (optional)
achieve 80% accuracy, as many epochs as you want. Total Params to be less than 1M.
